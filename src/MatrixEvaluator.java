 *
 * This Java program prompts a user for a file containing a boolean matrix, and then for a sequence of vertices.
 * The program then determines if and which of the following the given sequence of vertices represents:
 * -Open Walk
 * -Closed walk
 * -Trail
 * -Circuit
 * -Path
 * -Cycle
 *
 * The program will also generate the reflexive and symmetric closures of the input matrix and output the
 * matrix closures into a file for each.
